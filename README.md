# CityscapesDilatedConvolutionHighway280
I was inspired by David Abati's dilated convolutional github on semantic segmentation, trained on Cityscapes dataset.  I just want to reproduce his work using my own video.  

It is a very interesting topic.  According to "Semantic Segmentation Using Fully Convolutional Networks over the Years", written by
meetshah1995, feature upsampling the low-resolution segmentation maps to input image resolution using learned deconvolutions will totally
or partially avoid the reduction of resolution altogether in the encoder, using dilated convolutions.

The result of my duplication of David Abati's github using my own images and video is sort of similar, but it is not as perfect as his own augmented image.  I modified his python code to generate a dilated convolutional video of my own.

Here are youtube links generated from my own camera:
